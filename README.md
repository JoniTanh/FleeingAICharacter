# FleeingAICharacter

Very simple program; non-player character fleeing the player character (running away from the player). Include some little bugs - atleast for now.

If the AI gets stuck in a corner, take a distance from it and try chasing it again.

Created with C# and Unity.

Player movement:
- press 'space' to jump
- press 'aswd' or arrow keys to move
- rotate camera with mouse
- press 'escape' (ESC) to quit the game
